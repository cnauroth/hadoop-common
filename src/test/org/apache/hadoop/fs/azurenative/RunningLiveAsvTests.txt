In order to run ASV unit tests against a live Azure Storage account, you need to provide test account details in a config file called azure-site.xml.
This file must contain a value for "fs.azure.test.account.name" that specifies the account name to use, and a key for that account in fs.azure.account.key.{name}.
This file must also be in the classpath for the test to run.
Please see azure-site.example.xml for an example.

Simple steps to run the tests:
1. Copy azure-site.example.xml to a local directory, rename to azure-site.xml and fill in the actual account details.
2. To run from:
  a. Eclipse: Add that directory to the classpath for the test's Run Configuration.
  b. ant (command-line): Copy that file to build/test/extraconf, then run the test.
