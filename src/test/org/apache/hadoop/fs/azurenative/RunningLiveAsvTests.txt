In order to run ASV unit tests against a live Azure Storage account, you need to provide test account details in a config file called azure-site.xml.
This file must contain a value for "fs.azure.test.account.name" that specifies the account name to use, and a key for that account in fs.azure.account.key.{name}.
This file must also be in the classpath for the test to run.
Also, if you have storage emulator setup on your box, you should set fs.azure.test.emulator to true to test against it.
Please see azure-site.example.xml for an example.

Simple steps to run the tests:
1. Copy azure-site.example.xml to a local directory, rename to azure-site.xml and fill in the actual account details.
2. Set the value for fs.azure.test.emulator depending if you have storage emulator setup.
3. To run from:
  a. Eclipse: Add that directory to the classpath for the test's Run Configuration.
  b. ant (command-line): Copy that file to build/test/extraconf, then run the test.
